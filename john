john --list=formats | grep -iF "md5" - check needed format of all john's formats

john --format=Raw-SHA256 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash3.txt - crack hash in sha256 format
john --format=nt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ntlm.txt          - crack hash in NTML format
john --single --format=Raw-MD5 hash7.txt                                       - crack hash in a single mode

Crack /etc/passwd file
1) You need to take one line from /etc/shadow and one from /etc/passwd with the same user 
2) Insert them into two different files shadow.txt and passwd.txt
3) unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > password.txt
4) john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt passwords.txt

Crack zip password:
1) zip2john secure.zip > zip.txt
2) john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt zip.txt
3) unzip secure.zip

Crack rar archive:
1) rar2john secure.rar > rar.txt
2) john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rar.txt
3) unrar secure.rar

Cracking ssh key:
1) ssh2john idrsa.id_rsa > rsa.txt
2) john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rsa.txt

Cracking id_rsa key:
1) download key to the file
2) /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa> hash - convert the RSA key into text format(id_rsa is a file with a key)
3) john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash - brute force
